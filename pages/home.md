Hi. I’m Jen Simmons.

I’m a Designer and Developer Advocate at Mozilla, where I advocate for you and your needs with the team that makes the Firefox browser. I'm also a member of the CSS Working Group, the body that invents new CSS. I'm especially interested in [the coming revolution in graphic design](https://labs.jensimmons.com/) on the web, made newly possible by CSS Grid, Sizing, Writing Modes and more.

I [speak at conferences](https://talks.jensimmons.com), [make videos](http://youtube.com/layoutland), and write about what I discover. 

From 2011–2015, I was the host and executive producer of [The Web Ahead](http://thewebahead.net). As web designer and front-end developer with two-decades of experience, I wrote code for CERN, the W3C, Google, Drupal, and many more. Offline, I designed and built many works for the stage and the screen.

You can [follow me on Twitter](twitter.com/jensimmons).

<p>Graphic design on the web hasn't been that great. Lately it's been pretty boring, every website kind of copying all the others. For a long time, we've been held back by the limitations of CSS. Designers had good ideas. Developers would respond with 'nope, we can't do that, stop wanting that'.</p>

<p>Well, everything has changed. Actually, it changed a few years ago. We can finally apply real graphic design techniques to the web. We just have to remember that we want to.</p>
