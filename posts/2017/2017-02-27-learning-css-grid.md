People are starting to ask: where can I learn about CSS Grid?

There are a lot of fantastic resources out there. When it comes to the technical how-to, most of what’s out there was written by <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk">Rachel Andrew</a>.  If you don’t know her work, take some time to get to know her and <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelandrew">follow her</a>.

So here are the links to resources I recommend. I will keep updating this list:
<ul>
<li>Rachel built a website full of examples, that walk you through what Grid can do: <a href="http://gridbyexample.com/examples/"> gridbyexample.com/examples</a></li>
<li>She also created a series of free screencast tutorials that show off Grid: <a href="http://gridbyexample.com/video/">gridbyexample.com/video</a></li>
<li>She has started a gallery of common layouts you might want to use: <a href="http://gridbyexample.com/patterns/">gridbyexample.com/patterns</a></li>
<li>Rachel also put together a polished course on all the CSS you need to know to hand-code layout: <a href="https://thecssworkshop.com">https://thecssworkshop.com</a> It comes in two parts. You can buy access to Part 1, Part 2 (which includes Grid), or both. (If you are able, paying to access these videos is a great way to support all this work Rachel is doing for free. Also, you’ll fill in any gaps in your overall knowledge of layout. I certainly did. There was a bunch of stuff I didn’t know, and I didn’t know I didn’t know it.)</li>
<li>Or learn from watching a full-length conference talk (or eight) of hers: <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=rachel+andrew&tbm=vid&*">find the most recent</a>.</li>
<li>And as always, MDN has a detailed technical documentation on everything you want to know <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout">about CSS Grid</a> including a well-written <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout">guide to the basic concepts</a>. How’d we put together such a comprehensive expert set of documents? We hired Rachel to write them.</li>
<li>Be sure to try out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Examine_grid_layouts">the Grid Inspector Tool</a> that is baked into Firefox. It’s very hard to code a Grid layout without being able to see your lines. My colleagues at Mozilla and I are aiming to give you a tool that makes it easy to develop and design Grid Layouts in the browser. Many more features have been planned, and will appear over next the year. <a href="/contact">Contact me</a> with any ideas, requests, comments on how the tool is working out for you. Such feedback — praise and critique — helps tremendously in wrangling resources to take things to the next level.</li>
<li>And then there’s the three years of work I’ve made, starting with my 2015 talk on layout design: <a href="http://jensimmons.com/presentation/modern-layouts-getting-out-our-ruts"> Modern Layouts: Getting Out Of Our Ruts
 </a></li>
<li>My 2016 talk on layout design<a href="http://jensimmons.com/presentation/revolutionize-your-page-real-art-direction-web"> Revolutionize Your Page: Real Art Direction on the Web
 </a></li>
<li>My talk on using new CSS today, even when all the browsers don’t support it: <a href="http://jensimmons.com/presentation/progressing-our-layouts">Progressing Our Layouts</a></li>
<li>And my demos at: <a href="http://labs.jensimmons.com">labs.jensimmons.com</a></li>
<li>How will we use CSS Grid, even when it’s not supported by 100% of browsers? By <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/using-feature-queries-in-css/">Using Feature Queries in CSS</a>.</li>
<li>To really understand layout CSS, you should also learn about <a href="https://24ways.org/2016/css-writing-modes/">CSS Writing Modes</a></li>
<li>Chen Hui Jing wrote a fantastic article, on writing modes: <a href="https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/chinese-web-typography/"></a> with a <a href="https://www.chenhuijing.com/zh-type/">amazing demo</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/tTV60oAk6Cs?t=1m52s">a talk</a>.</li>
<li>Jing made a second amazing <a href="http://penang-hokkien.gitlab.io">Writing Mode demo</a> and wrote a great <a href="https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/the-one-about-home/#=_">article about it.</a> I don’t think it uses CSS Grid, but it shows the kind of thinking we’ll be using in the future.</li>
<li>While you are at it, follow Jing on Twitter, too: <a href="https://twitter.com/hj_chen">@hj_chen</a></li>
<li>Rachel also made a cheatsheet for the stuff you'll need to look up the most: <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/css/cheatsheets/box-alignment">Box Alignment Cheatsheet</a></li>
<li>For many people, their first question about Grid is: why should I use this instead of Flexbox? Rachel answers that here: <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/03/30/should-i-use-grid-or-flexbox/">Should I use Grid or Flexbox?</a></li>
<li>She also answered the all important IE question — in this case: <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/11/26/should-i-try-to-use-the-ie-implementation-of-css-grid-layout/">Should we try to use the old IE 10 & 11 implementation of Grid?</a></li>
<li>In fact, so many people are asking Rachel questions, she setup a GitHub repo as an AMA. So just go there and ask her more stuff / find more answers: <a href="https://github.com/rachelandrew/cssgrid-ama">CSS Grid Ask Me Anything</a></li>
<li>Belén Albeza wrote a relevant article about the things you might want to consider when deciding how to architect your project, <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/04/you-might-not-need-a-css-framework/">You might not need a CSS framework</a></li>
<li>Want a quick way to start messing with CSS Grid <em>right now</em>, without having to find a place to write code? Try <a href="https://www.cssgridplayground.com">CSS Grid Playground</a></li>
</ul>

There will be much more coming from Rachel, Jing and me this year.

I am starting to see a bunch of simple introductions, link-baity false-narratives, and weirdly-wrong ideas to creep into the conversation about CSS Grid. They are not as helpful. Frequently they are actually wrong. Let’s please share the best work with each other — not exclusively work done by men because it seems more respectable / more authoritative / more bro-awesome! And especially, let’s not pass around the work published by people who simply copied Rachel’s work, badly, with mistakes. In 2017, I have no more patience for these shenanigans. So far, most of the people I’ve seen learning, teaching and evangelizing CSS Grid are women. If suddenly we all “disappear”, and a bunch of men get all the attention, my head might explode. 

If you see any new resources that are <em>good</em>, do let me know! I want to feature the most helpful work out there. Once you start learning CSS Grid, share what you’ve discovered. Explain things in a new way that feels helpful. Make demos unlike anything we’ve seen before. Credit the sources that taught and inspired you. Reference the larger conversation. There is a lot to learn. A lot for us to discover. A lot to invent. This truly is a revolution in graphic design on the web. There’s no time, and no reason to be all jockeying for the same worn-out boring territory, trying to make the people — the women — who got there first invisible.
